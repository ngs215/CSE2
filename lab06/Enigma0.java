/* Error report:
 *   Expand this comment:
 *   Variable n was declared and initialized in the if statetment and declared again after the else statement which resulted in a CE.
 *   To fix this problem I initialized variable n to equal zero at the begining of the program and removed all other instances where
 *   n was declared as an int.
